Welcome to my fourth project. This project is a blog website, using 2 different programs called Bootstrap and Django. I have also used 3 different languages: HTML5/CSS3 and Python. 

This project will show the use of CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The user will be able create, read, update and delete their user profile/comments on the blog.

# 1 - UX

I am a big fan of the website "Reddit", I have always used the website to browse different topics, and of course getting involved. 

This project will showcase simplicity and ease to sign up to a blog, start a discussion, discuss with other users and get involved!

### Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to allow the user to sign up, sign in/out, create/update a user profile and create/update/delete a blog in a simple and effective process.

### User Goals:
First Time Visitor Goals
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to book a sign up to the website 
-   As a first-time visitor, I want to view the menu for all current blog discussions.

Returning Visitor Goals
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to log back into the terminal.
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to like and comment discussions
-   As a Returning Visitor, I want to edit any previous coomments or start topics.

Frequent User Goals
-   As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are more debates being added by various users and to get involved with the community.

### User Expectations:
The system should have a simple user interface, with the navigation to each section clear and concise.

-   The blog posts are clear to read.
-   The user interface is easy to navigate.
-   The website is responsive on all devices.
-   To have the ability to sign up via social media/online

### User Stories
Throughout the project I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep focus on the specific tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed. As you see below - you can see the story planned out with screenshots showing my progression.

# 2 Structure

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

- Responsive on all device sizes
- Easy navigation through labelled buttons
- Footer at the bottom of the index page that links to the social media website.
- All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.
